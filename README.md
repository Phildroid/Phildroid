- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Phildroid
I'm a penultimate student at the University of Ibadan, where I major in Computer Science. 
I thoroughly enjoy being in tech and being a problem solver. For now, I'm looking forward to put my technical skills into practice by delivering expertise in Computer Vision and Site Reliability Engineering (Yes, I'm interested in both!).

My greatest strength lies in being ambitious, relentless and daringly self-driven. I have talent for clear communication and I am passionate about providing remarkable value to any team. As a young man, I value integrity, hard work and excellence. 

Lastly, I bring an unmistakable aura of drive and energy into any team I join.
